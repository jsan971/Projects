# Projects

I wanted to share that my GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive collection of all the coding projects I've worked on during my time at university. It includes a diverse range of assignments, exercises, and larger projects from various courses. Feel free to explore the repository to get an overview of the skills and technologies I've engaged with during my academic journey.

Best,
Jacob Sanchez
